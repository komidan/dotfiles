### Dotfiles

Base desktop environment XFCE on Debian 12 Bookworm Edition

PROGRAMS:
- i3           (window manager)
- i3lock-fancy (better lock-screen)
- polybar      (i3-status replacement)
- kitty        (terminal emulator)
- oh-my-posh   (prompt theme engine)
- nitrogen     (sets background)
- nvim >v11    (text/code editor)

```
TODO:
    - Search more through kitty documentation.
    - (?) Fix OH-MY-POSH configuration, feels buggy with kitty at
      the moment.
    - Polybar maybe fix double-space between "ram  N%" and "cpu  N%"?
```
