### Dotfiles

Base desktop environment XFCE on Debian 12 Bookworm Edition

PROGRAMS:
- i3          (window manager)
- polybar     (i3-status replacement)
- kitty       (terminal emulator)
- oh-my-posh  (prompt theme engine)
- nitrogen    (sets background)
- nvim >v11   (text/code editor)

```
TODO:
    [X] Figure out how to alter copy & paste functionality in NVIM to 
        be more intuitive.
    [ ] Search more through kitty documentation.
    [ ] (?) Fix OH-MY-POSH configuration, feels buggy with kitty at
        the moment.
    [ ] Polybar maybe fix double-space between "ram  N%" and "cpu  N%".
```
